            Staking is the act of depositing 32ETH to activate validator
            software. As a validator you’ll be responsible for storing data,
            processing transactions, and adding new blocks to the blockchain.
            This will keep Ethereum secure for everyone and earn you new ETH in
            the process. This process, known as proof-of-stake, is being
            introduced by the{" "}

            <p>
              Staking is what you need to do to become a validator in a
              proof-of-stake system. This is a consensus mechanism that is going
              to replace the proof-of-work system currently in place. Consensus
              mechanisms are what keep blockchains like Ethereum secure and
              decentralized.{" "}
              <Link to="/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/">
                More on consensus mechanisms
              </Link>
            </p>

            <p>Proof-of-stake helps secure the network in a number of ways:</p>
            <h3>Your ETH is at stake</h3>
            <p>
              Because you have to stake your ETH in order to validate
              transactions and create new blocks, you can lose it if you decide
              to try and cheat the system.
            </p>
            <h3>More validators, more security</h3>
            <p>
              In a blockchain like Ethereum it is possible to corrupt it if you
              control <Link to="/glossary/#51-attack">51% of the network</Link>.
              For example you could get 51% of validators to state that your
              balance reads 1,000,000 ETH and not 1 ETH. But, to control 51% of
              validators, you’d need to own 51% of the ETH in the system –
              that’s a lot!
            </p>
            <p>
              Staking makes joining the network as a validator more accessible
              so it’s likely that there’ll be more validators in the network
              than exists today. This will make this kind of attack even harder
              as the cost of an attack will increase.
