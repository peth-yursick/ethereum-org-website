              Key to the Eth2 upgrades is the introduction of staking. If you
              want to use your ETH to help secure the Ethereum network, make
              sure you follow these steps.

            <h3>1. Set up with the launchpad</h3>
            <p>
              To stake in Eth2 you’ll need to use the launchpad – this will walk
              you through the process.

            <h3>2. Confirm staking address</h3>
            <p>
              Before you stake your ETH, be sure to check you’ve got the right
              address. You must have gone through the launchpad before doing
              this.

                Think of Eth2 as a set of upgrades being added to improve the
                Ethereum we use today. These upgrades include the creation of a
                new chain called the beacon chain and up to 64 chains known as
                shards.{" "}
              </p>

                Eth holders certainly don't need to do anything. Your ETH will

                To become a full validator on the network, you'll need to stake

                that much, you can join staking pools. These pools will let you
                stake less and earn fractions of the total rewards.

            >
              <p>
                The Eth2 upgrades will help Ethereum scale in a decentralized
                way, while maintaining security, and increasing sustainability.
              </p>
              <p>
                Perhaps the most obvious problem is that Ethereum needs to be
                able to handle more than 15-45 transactions per second. But the
                Eth2 upgrades also address some other problems with Ethereum
                today.
              </p>
              <p>
                The network is in such high demand that it's making Ethereum
                expensive to use. Nodes in the network are struggling under the
                size of Ethereum and the amount of data their computers are
                having to process. And the underlying algorithm that keeps
                Ethereum secure and decentralized is energy intensive andd needs
                to be greener.
