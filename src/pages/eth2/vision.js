            <p>
              The Ethereum protocol that launched in 2015 has had incredible
              success. But the Ethereum community always expected that a few key
              upgrades would be necessary to unlock Ethereum's full potential.
            </p>
            <p>
              High demand is driving up transaction fees that make Ethereum
              expensive for the average user. The disk space needed to run an
              Ethereum client is growing at a fast rate. And the underlying
              Proof of Work consensus algorithm that keeps Ethereum secure and
              decentralized has a big environmental impact.
            </p>
          </Column>
          <Column>
            <p>
              What is commonly referred to as Eth2 is a set of upgrades that
              address these problems and more. This set of upgrades was{" "}
              <Link to="https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/">
                originally called "Serenity"
              </Link>
              , and have been an active area of research and development{" "}
              <Link to="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/01/15/slasher-a-punitive-proof-of-stake-algorithm/">
                going back to 2014
              </Link>
              . Now that the technology is ready, these upgrades will
              rearchitect Ethereum to make it more scalable, secure, and
              sustainable – to make life better for existing users and entice
              new ones. All while preserving Ethereum's core value of
              decentralization.
            </p>
            <p>
              This means there’s no on-switch for Eth2. Improvements will ship
              incrementally over time.

            Scalability <Emoji text=":rocket:" />
          </h3>
          <p>
            Ethereum needs to be able to handle more transactions per second
            without increasing the size of the{" "}
            <Link to="/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#what-are-nodes-and-clients">
              nodes
            </Link>{" "}
            in the network. Increasing node size isn't practical because only
            those with powerful and expensive computers could do it. To scale,
            Ethereum needs more transactions per second, coupled with more
            nodes. More nodes means more security.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            The <Link to="/eth2/shard-chains/">shard chain upgrade</Link> will
            spread the load of the network into 64 new chains. This will give
            Ethereum room to breathe by reducing congestion and improving speeds
            beyond the current 15-45 transactions per second limit.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            And even though there will be more chains, this will actually
            require less work from validators - the maintainers of the network".
            Validators will only need to "run" their shard and not the entire
            Ethereum chain. This makes nodes more lightweight, allowing Ethereum
            to scale and remain decentralized.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Security <Emoji text=":shield:" />
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Eth2 upgrades improve Ethereum's security against coordinated
            attacks, like a <Link to="/glossary/#51-attack">"51% attack"</Link>.
            This is a type of attack where if someone controls the majority of
            the network they can force through fraudulent changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The transition to{" "}
            <Link to="/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/">
              proof-of-stake
            </Link>{" "}
            means that the Ethereum protocol has greater disincentives against
            attack. This is because in proof-of-stake, the validators who secure
            the network must stake significant amounts of ETH into the protocol.
            If they try and attack the network, the protocol can automatically
            destroy their ETH.
          </p>
          <p>
            This isn't possible in{" "}
            <Link to="/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/">
              proof-of-work
            </Link>
            , where the best a protocol can do is force entities who secure the
            network (
            <Link to="/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/mining/">
              miners
            </Link>
            ) to lose mining rewards they would have otherwise earned. To
            achieve the equivalent effect in proof-of-work, the protocol would
            have to be able to destroy all of a miner's equipment if they try
            and cheat.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ethereum's security model also needs to change because of the
            introduction of <Link to="/eth2/shard-chains/">shard chains</Link>.
            The <Link to="/eth2/beacon-chain/">Beacon Chain</Link> lets us
            randomly assign validators to different shards - this makes it
            virtually impossible for validators to ever collude by attacking a
            specific shard. Sharding isn't as secure on a proof-of-work
            blockchain, because miners can't be controlled by the protocol in
            this way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Staking also means you don’t need to invest in elite hardware to
            "run" an{" "}
            <Link to="/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/">Ethereum node</Link>.
            This should encourage more people to become a validator, increasing
            the network’s decentralization and decreasing the attack surface
            area.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can become a validator by{" "}

          <p>Ethereum needs to be greener.</p>
          <p>
            It's no secret that Ethereum and other blockchains like Bitcoin are
            energy intensive because of{" "}
            <Link to="/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/mining/">
              mining
            </Link>
            . But Ethereum is moving towards being secured by ETH, not computing
            power – via <Link to="/eth2/staking/">staking</Link> and{" "}
            <Link to="/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/">

            .
          </p>
          <p>
            Although staking will be introduced by{" "}
            <Link to="/eth2/beacon-chain/">the beacon chain</Link>, the Ethereum
            we use today will run in parallel for a period of time, before it
